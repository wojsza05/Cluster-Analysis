Tired of Topic Models? Clusters of Pretrained Word Embeddings Make for Fast and Good Topics too! (2020; Code for paper)
==============================

This repo fixes reproducibility problems with the implementation of the paper [Tired of Topic Models? Clusters of Pretrained Word Embeddings Make for Fast and Good Topics too!]( https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.135.pdf) (Sia, Dalmia, and Mieke; EMNLP, 2020).


## How to use the code
* Install requirements by `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
* Download pre-trained models, for example `wget https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/10798046 -O GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin`
* To cluster the word embeddings to discover the latent topics, run
```python code/score.py <arguments>```. The description of the arguments is given below:

### Required:
`--entities` : The type of pre-trained word embedding you are clustering with\
choices= word2vec, fasttext, glove, KG 
KG stands for your own set of embeddings 

`--entities_file`: The file name contain the embeddings 

`--clustering_algo`: The clustering algorithm to use  
choices= KMeans, SPKMeans, GMM, KMedoids, Agglo, DBSCAN , Spectral, VMFM

`--vocab`: List of vocab files to use for tokenization, for example `/usr/share/dict/words`

### Not Required:
`--dataset`: Dataset to test clusters against against\
default = 20NG 
choices= 20NG, reuters

`--preprocess`: Cuttoff threshold for words to keep in the vocab based on frequency 

`--use_dims`: Dimensions to scale with PCA (much be less than orginal dims)

`--num_topics`: List of number of topics to try 
default: 20

`--doc_info`: How to add document information
 choices= DUP, WGT
 
`--rerank`: Value used for reranking the words in a cluster  
choices=tf, tfidf, tfdf

Example call:
`python3 code/score.py --clustering_algo KMeans --vocab /usr/share/dict/words --entities word2vec`
